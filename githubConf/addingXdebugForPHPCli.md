To set the Xdebug path in your php.ini file on a Mac, follow these steps:

**Debugging PHP-CLI Script with VSCODE**
Requirements
*VSCode PHP Debug Extension should be installed* and create a launch.json file with php.

1. Locate Your php.ini File
First, you need to find where your php.ini file is located. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

php --ini
This will show you the path to the loaded configuration file (the php.ini file).

2. Install Xdebug
If you haven't already installed Xdebug, you can do so using Homebrew or download it manually.

If you’re using Homebrew, you can install Xdebug with:

pecl install xdebug
3. Find the Xdebug Extension Path
After installation, you can find the path to the Xdebug extension by running:

php -i | grep xdebug
This will show you the path to the Xdebug extension file, typically something like /usr/local/opt/php/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-xxxxxx/xdebug.so.

4. Edit php.ini
Open your php.ini file in a text editor:

nano /path/to/your/php.ini
Replace /path/to/your/php.ini with the path you found earlier.

5. Add Xdebug Configuration
Add or modify the following lines in your php.ini file:

[xdebug]
zend_extension="/path/to/xdebug.so" ; Replace with your actual path
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
6. Save and Exit
If you're using nano, save your changes by pressing CTRL + O, then exit with CTRL + X.

7. Restart Your Web Server or PHP Service
If you’re using a web server like Apache or Nginx, restart it to apply the changes:

For Apache:

sudo apachectl restart
For Nginx:

brew services restart nginx
If you're running PHP via the CLI, no restart is needed.

8. Verify Installation
You can verify that Xdebug is installed and configured correctly by running:

php -v
You should see Xdebug listed in the output.
