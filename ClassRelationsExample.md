Certainly! Below are examples of the six concepts in object-oriented programming: Inheritance, Implementation, Association, Dependency, Composition, and Aggregation. I'll use Python for these examples.

## 1. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

```php
class Animal {
    public function speak() {
        return "Animal speaks";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public function bark() {
        return "Woof!";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
echo $dog->speak(); // Inherited method
echo "\n";
echo $dog->bark();  // Dog's own method
```

## 2. Implementation

Implementation refers to a class implementing an interface.

```php
interface Shape {
    public function area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private $width;
    private $height;

    public function __construct($width, $height) {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function area() {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

$rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
echo $rect->area(); // Outputs: 50
```

## 3. Association

Association is a relationship where one class uses another class.

```php
class Teacher {
    private $name;

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

class Student {
    private $name;

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

// Association
$teacher = new Teacher("Mr. Smith");
$student = new Student("John Doe");

echo "{$teacher->getName()} teaches {$student->getName()}";
```

## 4. Dependency

Dependency means one class relies on another class.

```php
class Engine {
    public function start() {
        return "Engine started";
    }
}

class Car {
    private $engine;

    public function __construct(Engine $engine) {
        $this->engine = $engine;
    }

    public function startCar() {
        return $this->engine->start();
    }
}

$engine = new Engine();
$car = new Car($engine);
echo $car->startCar(); // Outputs: Engine started
```

## 5. Composition

Composition is a strong relationship where one class is a part of another class. If the parent object is destroyed, the child objects are also destroyed.

```php
class Wheel {
    public function __construct() {
        // Wheel created
    }
}

class Car {
    private $wheels;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->wheels = [new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel(), new Wheel()];
    }
}

$car = new Car();
// Wheels are created with the Car
```

## 6. Aggregation

Aggregation is a weaker relationship where one class contains references to another class. The lifetime of the contained objects is not strictly tied to the container.

```php
class Department {
    private $name;

    public function __construct($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

class University {
    private $departments = [];

    public function addDepartment(Department $department) {
        $this->departments[] = $department;
    }

    public function getDepartments() {
        return $this->departments;
    }
}

$cs = new Department("Computer Science");
$math = new Department("Mathematics");

$university = new University();
$university->addDepartment($cs);
$university->addDepartment($math);

foreach ($university->getDepartments() as $dept) {
    echo $dept->getName() . "\n";
}
```

These examples illustrate the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in PHP. Let me know if you have any questions!

### Certainly! Below are the relationships illustrated with arrows and brief explanations for each concept.

## 1. Inheritance

```yaml
Animal
   ▲
   |
   Dog
Relationship: Dog inherits from Animal.
```

## 2. Implementation

```mathematica
Shape
   ▲
   |
Rectangle
Relationship: Rectangle implements the Shape interface.
```

## 3. Association

```lua
Teacher  -----------  Student
Relationship: Teacher and Student have an association; they can exist independently.
```

## 4. Dependency

```yaml
Engine
   ▲
   |
   Car
Relationship: Car depends on Engine. If Engine changes, it may affect Car.
```

## 5. Composition

```yaml
Car
   ▲
   |
 Wheel
Relationship: Car has a strong composition with Wheel. If Car is destroyed, so are its Wheels.
```

## 6. Aggregation

```lua
University  <>-------  Department
Relationship: University has an aggregation relationship with Department. Departments can exist independently of the University.
```
